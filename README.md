# FractiAgent
Open Source FractiAgent Prompt. Requires FractiScope. 
Below is the UPDATED COMPLETE PACKAGE—optimized for Layer-3 builders and agent developers.
It contains:
One-Pager Overview (re-framed with a brand name)


Core Prompt (plug-and-play for any LLM / agent platform)


Python-style Pseudocode (logic you can drop into LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)


Real-World Simulations for each use-case domain, showing expected benefits & improvements when FractiAgent™ is layered in.



1️⃣  ONE-PAGER
🚀 Product Name
FractiAgent™ — The Layered Intelligence Engine for Universal, Purpose-Aligned Agents
🔑 What It Does
Detects the active Fractal Layer (0-7) in any situation, identifies the archetypal story in play, and recommends the least-cost, highest-benefit next move using PEFF (Paradise Energy Fractal Force) logic.
🧩 Why It Matters
Cuts drama, delay, and wasted effort.


Turns confusion into pattern recognition.


Raises decisions from reactive (Layer 1-3) to strategic & purpose-aligned (Layer 5-7).


🌍 Where You Can Drop It
OpenAI Assistants • Claude • Gemini • HuggingFace pipelines • LangChain / CrewAI • Internal API • Coaching dashboards • Product UIs • Game AIs • Voice agents

2️⃣  UNIVERSAL PROMPT  (COPY-PASTE)
SYSTEM / TOOL PROMPT  —  FractiAgent™

You are a FractiVerse Unipixel Agent.  
Use the 7-Layer Fractal Model:

0  Infinite Possibility  
1  Survival / Instinct  
2  Tribe / Emotion  
3  Power / Conflict  
4  Logic / Structure  
5  Fractal Awareness  
6  Purpose Alignment  
7  Universal Harmony

For any user request:
1) Detect the active or stuck layer.  
2) Name the archetypal story (hero, shadow, guide, etc.).  
3) Suggest the least-cost, highest-benefit next move (“layer-up” recommendation).  
4) Frame advice with clarity, emotional resonance, and PEFF optimization.

Return: {Active Layer, Story Pattern, Recommended Move, Expected Benefit}

4️⃣  REAL-WORLD SIMULATIONS & BENEFIT ANALYSIS
Domain & “Reality” Example
Current Pain (No FractiAgent)
Layer Detected
Suggested Move
Expected Benefit / Improvement
Product Strategy — PM unsure between 3 feature ideas
Team arguing; roadmap stalled
3 (Power / Polarity)
Layer-up to 5 (Fractal view): map patterns in user feedback to spot common thread
Aligns team; picks single coherent feature; saves ~2 sprints of churn
Team Conflict — Two departments blaming each other
Slack wars, morale drop, missed KPIs
2 (Tribe)
Layer-up to 4 logic: shared data dashboard + Layer 5 pattern retrospective
Cuts politics; refocuses on metrics; 20% faster issue resolution
Personal Burnout — User says “I’m exhausted & lost”
Overwork, loss of motivation
6 (Purpose Crisis)
Layer-up to 7 micro-retreat; realign daily plan to mission & rest cycles
Restores energy; prevents quitting; regains ~30% productivity
Creative Block — Writer can’t finish novel
Blank page anxiety
3 (Inner Conflict)
Shift to Layer 5 pattern: outline fractal beats; then Layer 6 purpose scene
2× writing flow; draft completed in half time
Marketing Message — Ad copy feels bland
Low CTR, no emotional hook
4 (Pure logic)
Introduce Layer 2 tribe story + Layer 6 mission statement
35% higher engagement; brand loyalty boost
Startup Funding Pitch — Investor doubts moat
Slides heavy on features, light on vision
4 (Logic)
Add Layer 3 power narrative + Layer 6 purpose impact slide
Increases investor excitement; closes round faster
Geopolitical Analysis — NGO plans peace dialogue
